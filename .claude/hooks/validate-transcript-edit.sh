# Hook: Enforce session transcript append-only rule (DSM_0.2 §7)
# Fires on PreToolUse for Edit calls to *session-transcript.md, and (BL-552)
# for Bash calls that redirect into it. The two paths validate different
# things because different things are knowable: the Edit path sees old_string
# and new_string and checks all four rules below; the Bash path sees only a
# command string and checks the two that survive that (delimiter present, and
# the unquoted-heredoc backtick hazard). The Bash branch states its own
# coverage limits at its head rather than here.
# Four validations on the Edit path (0-3 block; 4 warns):
# 1. old_string must be anchored to the last non-empty line of the file
# 2. new_string must start with old_string (append-only, no replacement)
# 3. Appended content must contain a <------------Start {timestamp}------------>
#    delimiter (ensures every entry is timestamped)

# --- Bash branch (BL-552) -------------------------------------------------
# DSM_0.2 §7 sanctions TWO append paths and, until this branch, only one was
# inspected. This hook was registered on the Edit matcher alone, so a Bash
# heredoc append reached the transcript ungated , and the heredoc is not an
# exotic path: §7 names it the REQUIRED fallback whenever the Edit path is
# closed, which BL-500 documents as the case where the last non-empty line
# recurs earlier in the file and the anchor rule and Edit's uniqueness rule
# become jointly unsatisfiable.
#
# So the sanctioned fallback was, by construction, the unvalidated one, and
# the hook routed its own catch into its own blind spot: in S258 check 1/4
# correctly BLOCKED a two-line Edit anchor, the recovery went through an
# unquoted heredoc, and three backtick-quoted spans were executed as shell
# commands instead of being written. The surviving prose still read as fluent
# English with the spans simply missing. Recorded by four consecutive analysis
# runs (S252, S253, S254, S258) before it was filed.
#
# WARN, never block; detection is a floor, not a proof. Both choices are
# INHERITED from validate-cross-repo-write.sh's BL-484 branch rather than
# re-decided: shell is not statically analysable, a parser that blocks on a
# guess produces false blocks on ordinary commands, and a gate the operator
# learns to dismiss is worse than no gate, because a reflex-dismissed gate
# still reads as protection. Exit 1 is the documented non-blocking channel.
#
# WHO SEES THE WARNING (measured S259, 2026-09-09). A non-zero hook exit is
# recorded in the session JSONL as a hook_non_blocking_error attachment carrying
# the full stderr, which reaches the transcript and the UI. It is NOT surfaced
# into the tool result the AGENT reads. So this branch warns the human and the
# record, not the writer, and it is a detector for review rather than a live
# correction. Same correction applied to validate-cross-repo-write.sh, whose
# BL-484 comment carried the imprecise wording this inherited.
#
# NOT COVERED, stated so this branch does not over-claim relative to what it
# actually inspects:
#   * Check 1's ANCHOR has no Bash analogue. A heredoc append carries no
#     old_string, so there is nothing to anchor and nothing to compare.
#   * Check 2's APPEND-ONLY becomes the truncating `>` redirect, which is
#     deliberately NOT flagged: /dsm-go Step 6 legitimately resets the
#     transcript with `cat > ... << EOF` at every boot, so flagging it would
#     fire on ordinary work in every session, which is the over-firing
#     failure DSM_0.2 §8.9.2 names. Accepted as a coverage limit.
#   * Check 4's timestamp drift stays Edit-only rather than being duplicated
#     here; two copies of the same arithmetic drift apart, which is the
#     BL-490 restated-literal family.
#   * Variable-constructed paths, eval, and computed heredoc targets evade
#     the redirect match by design.

WARNING: Session transcript Bash append (DSM_0.2 §7, BL-552).

$BASH_FINDINGS

This is a WARNING, not a block. The command has gone through.

B1 , every appended entry must carry a delimiter:
  <------------Start Plan / HH:MM------------>

B2 , an UNQUOTED heredoc performs command substitution on backticks as well as
on \$(...). A backtick-quoted term in ordinary prose is EXECUTED and replaced by
its output, and the surviving text still reads as fluent English with the span
missing. DSM_0.2 §7 names only the \$(...) direction; BACKLOG-500 is the
protocol-text half of this gap.
FIX: single-quote the heredoc (<< 'EOF') when the body contains backticks, or
prefer the Edit append path, which this hook validates in full.

Edit with replace_all: true is never allowed on .claude/session-transcript.md.
The append-anchor rule assumes a unique last-line anchor; replace_all duplicates
your new content at every match and explodes the file (IronCalc S17: 95 MB).

FIX: Use a normal append Edit (replace_all absent/false): read the last 3 lines,
anchor old_string on the last non-empty line, set new_string = old_string + new
content. To recover from a botched transcript Edit, append a [RETROACTIVE] note
via a Bash heredoc — never a replace_all cleanup.

# --- Check 4: delimiter timestamp against the wall clock (WARNS, never blocks) ---

WARNING: Session transcript delimiter timestamp drift (DSM_0.2 §7, check 4/4).

  delimiter says : $DELIM_TS
  wall clock is  : $NOW_TS
  drift          : $DRIFT minutes

This is a WARNING, not a block. The append has gone through.

A delimiter's HH:MM is the time the block BEGINS, read from the clock at that
moment, never carried forward from an earlier block or estimated. A drifted
stamp makes the transcript unusable as a timeline: three recorded sessions had
an action logged BEFORE the turn that authorised it.

FIX: read the clock (\`date +%H:%M\`) when you open the block. If this append is
a [RETROACTIVE] entry, it must still carry the CURRENT time, not the time you
are reconstructing.
